## 🎯 Objective
To build a dynamic visual tool to help understand the internal workings of the **Selection Sort** algorithm.

## 🚀 Features
- Generate a random array of 20 integers between 10–99.
- Animate Selection Sort in real-time with colored bars.
- Pause/Stop sorting process at any point.
- Status messages explain each step of sorting.

## 🎨 Color Legend
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🔵 Blue | Current element |
| 🟠 Orange | Current minimum element |
| 🟩 Green | Sorted element |
| ⚪ Gray | Unsorted element |

## 🧠 How to Use
1. Click **"Generate New Array"** to create new values.
2. Click **"Run Selection Sort"** to start visualizing the algorithm.
3. Use the **"Stop"** button to pause the sort.
4. Read the **status messages** to follow what's happening.

## 📦 Local Setup
