🔍 Selection Sort Visualizer
An interactive and animated visualizer for the Selection Sort algorithm, built using JavaScript and D3.js. This tool offers a more engaging way to understand how Selection Sort works through real-time animations and intuitive UI controls.

🎯 Purpose
To make learning sorting algorithms more interactive, visual, and accessible — especially for students and educators seeking to understand the step-by-step process of Selection Sort.

🚀 Key Features
🎲 Random Array Generation
Instantly generate an array of 20 random integers (between 10–99) represented as vertical bars.

🌀 Live Sorting Animation
Watch the Selection Sort algorithm in action — elements being compared, minimum selection, and swaps are visually represented.
